POINTS TO CONSIDER:
•	Create a new Java (Maven, gradle), C#(.NET core/framework) project with an appropriate test framework like Nunit, TestNG, cucumber etc.,
•	Automate tests in Chrome browser
•	Use parameterized data instead of hardcoded test data
•	Use Page Object Model with Selenium as much as possible
•	Make your functions more generic and use coding best practices as much as possible
•	Once the test is done, please zip the entire project and send it to us
